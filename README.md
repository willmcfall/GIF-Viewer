# GIF - VIEWER

## Overview

This dynamic web page draws from the GIPHY API and allows the user to view batches of gifs that present basic human emotions. The gifs are presented through either the click of a button on pre-populate emotions or through the submission of additional emotions based on a user entered field.

## Specifications

* The web applicatin should define an initial array of human emotions and create buttons for the user to select

* The web application should use a loop that appends a button for each string in the initial array

* The web application should allow the user to click on a button which will then cause the page to grab 25 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the webpage.

* The web application should allow the user to click on a still GIPHY image causing the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing. 

* The web application should present the gif rating (PG, G, etc.) and title above the gif image.

* The web application should add a form which takes a value from a user input box and adds it into the emotions array. The application should then make a function call that takes each emotion in the array and remakes the buttons on the page.

* Deploy your assignment to Github Pages.
